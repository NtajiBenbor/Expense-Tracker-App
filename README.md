## 1. Project Overview 😄

This project is an **Expense Tracker App** designed to help users manage and track their expenses efficiently. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete expense entries while providing a real-time update on their total spending. Built with JavaScript, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome, the app ensures a responsive and user-friendly experience. Future enhancements could include integrating with an external database for persistent storage and implementing user authentication.

## 3. Why I built this ❓

I built this project to solidify my understanding of JavaScript and Bootstrap, particularly in creating dynamic, interactive web applications. It was an opportunity to work on DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage, enhancing my problem-solving skills and learning new techniques for managing state within the browser.

## 4. What I learned while building this project

- **DOM Manipulation:** I gained deeper insight into dynamically updating the DOM based on user interactions, such as adding and removing rows in a table.

- **Event Handling:** This project provided extensive practice with handling various user events like form submissions, button clicks, and date validations.

- **Local Storage:** I learned how to utilize the browser's local storage for persisting data, allowing the app to maintain state across page reloads.

- **Bootstrap Integration:** Using Bootstrap's grid system and components, I created a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes effortlessly.

- **JavaScript Best Practices:** Working with modular functions and maintaining clean, readable code was a key focus throughout this project.
